# Requirements Specification Document

This document outlines the technical and functional requirements for three core backend features of the Airbnb Clone system.

---

## 1. User Authentication

### Functional Requirements
- Users must be able to register with an email and password.
- Users must be able to log in with valid credentials.
- Users receive an authentication token (JWT) upon successful login.
- Passwords must be hashed before storage.

### API Endpoints

**POST /api/register**  
- Input: JSON
  ```json
  {
    "first_name": "Kwame",
    "last_name": "Ametepe",
    "email": "kameamets@mainfest.com",
    "password": "securePass123"
  }
  ```
- Output: `201 Created` with success message or `400 Bad Request` on validation failure.

**POST /api/login**  
- Input: JSON
  ```json
  {
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "securePass123"
  }
  ```
- Output: `200 OK` with JWT token or `401 Unauthorized` if credentials are invalid.

### Validation Rules
- Email must be in valid format and unique.
- Password must be at least 8 characters.

### Performance Criteria
- Authentication response within 500ms under normal load.
- Support concurrent logins without performance degradation.

## 2. Property Management

### Functional Requirements
- Hosts can create, update, and delete their own properties.
- Guests can view listed properties.
- Properties include name, description, location, price, and availability.

### API Endpoints

**POST /api/properties** 
- Input: JSON
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Bay View",
    "description": "Beautiful sea-facing apartment",
    "location": "Accra",
    "pricepernight": 120.00
  }
  ```
- Output: `201 Created` or `400 Bad Request`.

**GET /api/properties**  
- Output: `200 OK` with a list of properties.

### Validation Rules
- All fields required except optional amenities.
- Price must be a positive decimal number.

### Performance Criteria
- Property listing should return results within 300ms.
- Filtered searches (e.g., by location or price) must be optimized with indexed queries.

## 3. Booking System

### Functional Requirements
- Guests can book available properties.
- System calculates total cost based on dates.
- Prevents overlapping bookings for the same property.

### API Endpoints

**POST /api/bookings**  
- Input: JSON
  ```json
  {
    "property_id": "uuid-123",
    "user_id": "uuid-456",
    "start_date": "2025-06-01",
    "end_date": "2025-06-07"
  }
  ```
- Output: `201 Created` with booking details or `409 Conflict` for date overlap.

**GET /api/bookings/{user_id}**  
- Output: List of bookings for a user.

### Validation Rules
- Start date must be before end date.
- Total price is auto-calculated.

### Performance Criteria
- Booking operation should complete in under 1 second.
- Conflict checks must be atomic and consistent to avoid double bookings.

## Notes
- All endpoints are secured using JWT.
- Input validation is enforced at both client and server level.
- Errors follow standard HTTP status codes and provide informative messages.
